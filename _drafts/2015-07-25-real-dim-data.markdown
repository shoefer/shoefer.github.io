In the last post we have looked at the biggest problem of data science: when we want to learn [functions](/intuds/2015/07/20/functions.html) from data, we have to fight overfitting. We will now look at the concept of *dimensionality* to understand why overfitting is actually such a big problem.

We should agree by now that [data is a bunch of numbers](/intuds/2015/07/19/data-numbers-representations.html) encoding some information, and that data can be multi-dimensional which makes them live in [vector spaces](/intuds/2015/07/22/vector-spaces.html). In this post we want to look at the very important concept of *dimensionality* more closely.
