<p>I&#8217;m a PhD student at the <a title="Robotics &amp; Biology Lab" href="http://www.robotics.tu-berlin.de" target="_blank">Robotics &amp; Biology Lab</a> at TU Berlin, Germany. My main research interest lies in  robots who learn autonomously from their own interaction how to successfully manipulate their environment.
